            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>This ANTIDOTE is an admirable Preservative against all Contagious, Pestilential and Epidemick Diseases; expells all manner of Poysons, and purifies and sweetens the whole Mass of Blood; wasts, consumes and drives out, by Sweat and Urine, the corrupt and vicious Humours of the Body, and disposes Running Sores and Ulcers, as well Internal as External, to heal and cure; and suffers no offensive Humours to remain in the Body, no, though they lie in the very Bones; and is very good for driving out the Small-pox, Measles, and the like malignant and putrid Diseases.</p>
            <p>It cures all Colds and Pains in the Head, Coughs, Rheums and Hoarseness, and wonderfully strengthens and relieves the Breast and Lungs oppress'd with <hi>Astma's,</hi> Phthisicks, Pleurisies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prevents and restores People falling into Consumptions, and helps to admiration those that linger under long and wasting Diseases; cheers the Heart, and resists the Passions thereof, Palpitations, Fainting, Swoonings, Sadness, Melancholy; corroborates the Stomach, encreaseth Appetite, promotes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, and is of singular Virtue in all Surfeits, Crudities and Indigestion of the Stomach and Bowels; kills Worms in Children, and destroys the morbifick matter from whence they are bred; cures Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Griping Fluxes of the Belly, whether Bloody or other: and therefore most necessary for all Sea-faring Men.</p>
            <p>It comforts and strengthens the <hi>Viscera,</hi> Liver and Spleen, and opens all Obstructions thereof; and both prevents and cures all <hi>Cachexia's</hi> or evil habits of the Body, as the Scurvy, with all its Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the Dropsie and Jaundice; and has a most incomparable Specifick quality for the Cure of Agues, and intermitting Fevers of all sorts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Quotidian, Tertian, Quartan, if prudently and seasonably made use of.</p>
            <p>This Noble ANTIDOTE easeth all Pains and Weariness in the Body and Limbs, which are the frequent fore-runners of approaching Sickness; and by its innate propriety asswages the violent Pains in the Gout, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>In the Female Sex it wonderfully repels Vapours, strangling and suffocating Fits of the Mother; prevents Abortion and Miscarriage in Women, occasion'd from windy, cold and moist Humours; and may advantageously and safely be taken by Women with Child after Vomitings, in their Fainting-Fits, and Stomach-Qualms.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In all Diseases arising from cold, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Anth.) moist or putrid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Bodies of Men, Women and Children, there is not a more Noble Medicine to be found; and is more safe, and by far exceeds the ancient Compositions of <hi>Mithridate</hi> and <hi>Venice-Treacle,</hi> those grand Medicines of the Apothecaries, which no one of them ever did or could make True:

               </q> One small Box of this ANTIDOTE being worth a Pound of any of those Farraginous Medicines if they were made True; and deserves to be treasured up by all Families, in the room of those adulterate and vicious Compositions which the <hi>Company of Apothecaries</hi> are now going to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare at their <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> to the Scandal of their Fraternity, and the future Ruine of the Society.</p>
